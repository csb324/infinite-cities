# Ok, so you noticed we have a server.

Honestly do not worry about it. This server is doing barely anything. It's just saying, "If you hear someone ask for a file, give them that file, but only if they ask for a file they're supposed to be allowed to have (i.e. the ones in our "dist" folder or in our "public" folder)."
